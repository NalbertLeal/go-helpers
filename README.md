# GO-LODASH
#### A package inspired on lodashJS but written in Go.

Created to increase my skills with nvim and at same time create a usable package to the community.
After implement lodash funciontion in golang i plan to implement funcitions to specific go patterns (cocurency design patterns for example).

LodashJs implemented:

- Array 
 - [] _.chunk ==> array.Chunk
 - [] _.compact ==> array.Compact
 - [] _.concat ==> array.Concat
 - [] _.difference ==> array.Difference
 - [] _.differenceBy ==> array.DiffenrenceByIterrator AND array.DifferenceByMapKey
 - [] _.differenceWith ==> array.
 - [] _.drop ==> array.
